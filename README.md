# 🖼️ Image Processing with OpenCV

This project is an implementation of [FreeCodeCamp's Image Processing Course on YouTube](https://youtu.be/oXlwWbU8l2o?si=-NwaEiFhbrsb6bhp) using mini-scripts demonstrating fundamental image processing concepts using **OpenCV** in Python. The project covers a wide range of techniques from transformations to masking, histograms, gradients, and more.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy
   ```

2. **Run a script**:

   ```bash
   python [1]read.py
   ```

> Use the `d` key to close camera windows after execution.
